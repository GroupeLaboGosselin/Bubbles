function [CI, permCI] = makeCI(X2,y2,nPerm,condVec)

% MAKECI computes a weighted sum (cross-product; equivalent to
% least-squares multiple linear regression when X is random, which it
% should be) between the independent variables across trials and the
% dependent variable. Will also compute weighted sums with the trial
% ordering randomly permuted to obtain a null distribution. Can handle the 
% presence of conditions.
%
% X2 is the (preprocessed) sampling array. The first dimension should be
% the trials and the following dimensions represent the sampling
% dimensions. Preferably, X should contain only bubble centers. These can
% be normalized or not, in which case X can be a logical array (this will
% quicken the analysis).
%
% Y2 is the (preprocessed) 1 x nTrials vector of responses. Responses 
% cannot be multidimensional for now.
%
% NPERM is the desired numper of permutations. Optional.
%
% CONDVEC is a 1 x nTrials vector representing the condition associated to
% each trial. Optional.
%
% CI is the resulting array of classification images representing which
% predictors/samples correlate with responses for each condition (condition
% being the last dimension).
%
% PERMCI is the array of permutation classification images (permutations 
% are the first dimension and condition is the last). Optional.

% TO DO
% Add possibility of multidimensional responses 
% Add possibility of using sampling matrices as shown (with cut-off)
% Add possibility of using permutations with resampling (bootstraps)
% Add possibility of using other functions (e.g. regression, mutual info)
